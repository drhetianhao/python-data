This is the source code repository to support the Pluralsight "Developing Python Apps with Docker" course.

Organization
============
The sections of the course build upon each other. As such, each module is divided into steps. As you follow along each module you can find the completed source code in each step folder. The final source code for the module is always in the last step.
